# Module 2: ROS 2 Basics Overview

Welcome to Module 2, where we dive into the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the foundational middleware for modern robotics development. This module will introduce you to the core concepts, architecture, and practical tools needed to build sophisticated robotic applications.

## Learning Goals for Weeks 3-5

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

*   **Understand the ROS Graph:** Grasp the fundamental components of ROS 2, including Nodes, Topics, Messages, Services, and Actions.
*   **Set up a ROS 2 Workspace:** Confidently create and manage your development environment for ROS 2 projects.
*   **Develop Basic ROS 2 Nodes in Python:** Write simple publisher and subscriber nodes to enable communication between robot components.
*   **Differentiate between Topics and Services:** Understand the appropriate use cases for streaming data versus request-response patterns in robotic systems.
*   **Troubleshoot Common ROS 2 Issues:** Gain skills in diagnosing and resolving typical problems encountered during development.

This module is crucial for anyone looking to develop robust, modular, and scalable robotic software.
